Write an Excellent Programming Blog (A. Jesse Jiryu Davis)
==========================================================

Why?
----

* Share your expertise
    - We are all specialists
    - We all do something that others don't do
* Meet fellow specialists
    - Communicate at the level of sharing ideas
* Even if noone reads what you write, writing is thinking
    - i.e. thought there was a bug in Python with Threadlocals
        - Writing it down before story finished help thinking


Common Excuse
-------------

Writer's block
* Not having enough time
* Can't come up with something to write

How to get over this?

What
----

Articles that are awesome

* Stories
    - Unyielding by glyph
    - Has a lesson along with a pretty image in your mind
* Opinion
* How to do something
* How something works?
* Reviews
    > I read, saw, played, or used something...
    > This is what I used and my experienced...
    > Strengths/weaknesses

    - Spend less time analyzing it, but more time discussing the experience and
      usage

Find your audience
------------------

NO SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

* Not trying to compete with people writing for max optimization

PlanetPython (Aggregators)

* Lot's of planets for various things

Specialists will find you!

Improve your writing
--------------------

Practice, read, get an editor

* Read the article to the end and summarize its effectiveness!

Make Time to Write

    > stream of constant content
