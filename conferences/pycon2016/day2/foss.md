Self-interest for a project will ultimately result in downfall.

What can I do about it?
-----------------------

* Connect with others
* Barriers?
* Become friends with legal?
* Financial contributions
* Write blog posts and give presentations
    - Talk about what you're making internally/externally

Thoughtful Contributions
------------------------

* High quality maintenance trumps features
* Consider the existing community members

Convince manager?
-----------------

* Behavioral Economics (Social Engineering)
    - The likelihood of having issues/bugs fixed
* Recruitment
* Vendor Management
